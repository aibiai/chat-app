Don’t rush into meeting — only do so when you’re ready. Tell a friend where you’re going and ask them to call or text to confirm your safety. Always bring a fully charged phone. Arrange your own transport to and from the meeting place — don’t meet at either person’s home. Avoid sharing your address unless you already know each other well.
